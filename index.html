  A GREAT city was once besieged, and all its inhabitants were gathered together to consider by what means it might be protected from the enemy.
A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as the best materials for successful defense.
  A carpenter with equal energy proposed timber as a preferable means of defense
Hearing which, a Currier stood up and said, “Sirs, I differ with you wholly. There is no material for resistance equal to a covering of hides, and nothing in the present case so good as leather.”

Once there were two Frogs who were dear friends.
</p>
<p>
One lived in a deep pond in the woods, where the trees hung over the water, and where no one came to disturb him.
</p>
<p>
The other lived in a small pool. This was not a good place for a Frog, or any one else, to live in, for the country road passed through the[59] pool, and all the horses and wagons had to go that way, so that it was not quiet like the pond, and the horses made the water muddy and foul.
</p>
</div>

<div class="t2">
<p>
One day the Frog from the pond said to the other, “Do come and live with me; I have plenty of food and water, and nothing to disturb me; and it is so pleasant in my pond. Now here there is very little food, and not much water, and the road passes through your pool, so that you must always be afraid of passers-by.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said the other Frog; “you are very kind, but I am quite content here. There is water enough; those who pass never trouble me; and as to food, I had a good dinner day before yesterday. I am used to[60] this place, you know, and do not like change. But come and see me as often as you can.”
</p>
</div>

<div class="t3">
<p>
The next time the Frog from the pond came to visit his friend, he could not find him.
</p>
<p>
“Too late!” sang a Bird, who lived in a tree that overhung the pool.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” said the Frog.
</p>
<p>
“Dead and gone!” said the Bird. “Run over by a wagon and killed, two days ago, and a big Hawk came and carried him off.”
</p>
<p>
“Alas! if he had only taken my advice, he might have been well and happy now,” said the Frog, as he turned sadly towards home; “but he would have his way, and I have lost my friend.”

ONE very stormy day a Poor Man came to a rich man’s house to beg.

<p>
“Away with you!” said the servants; “do not come here troubling us.”

<p>
Then said the Man, “Only let me come in and dry my clothes at your fire.” This, the servants thought, would not cost them anything; so they let him come in.
</p>
<p>
The Poor Man then asked the cook to let him have a pan, so that he could make some stone broth.
</p>
<p>
[72]
“Stone broth!” said the cook. “I should like to see how you can make broth out of a stone”; so she gave him a pan. The Man filled it with water from the pump, and then put into it a stone from the road. “But you must have some salt,” said the cook.
</p>
<p>
“Do you think so?” courteously replied the stranger. She gave him the salt, and before long she added some peas, some mint, and thyme. At last she brought him all the scraps of meat she could find, so that the Poor Man’s broth made him a good dinner.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” said the Man, “that if you only try long enough, and are cheerful, making the best of what you have, you may at last get what you want.”
